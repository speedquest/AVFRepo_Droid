            <p><h3>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only? (just a hint - iOS can be the tricky one)</h3></p> 
            Based on my research, since we are using the PhoneGap  software, the only native features we would not be able to access are the compass on older iPhone models.
            <h3>For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?</h3>
            I would like to implement the Geolocation, Notification, and camera for my CRUD app.
            <h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
            I have definitely learned that utilizing some sort of revision control is 100% necessary.  I am still not 100% sold on GitHub, as it still gives me problems.
            <h3>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h3>
            My app is supposed to be used to track your automobiles service intervals, fuel mileage, etc.  In a perfect world, it would track multiple vehicles and allow users to switch between those vehicles at will.  It would use the Geolocation to determine miles travelled, and would use Notification feature to alert users about important service milestones, etc.  Addtionally, I would love to be able to use the camera to scan the barcode VIN numbers that so many modern vehicles are equipped with nowadays.  We shall see…

            <p><h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h3></p> 
            I could use Apple’s Interface Builder to help make my app more accessible.  It allows a developer to add an even higher level of accessibility to his/her software.  Using ALT descriptions will also make my design more usable and accessible for users.  Also, adding accessibility labels to elements within the pages can help.
            <h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h3>
            High price of the accessibility software is actually a problem for many of the end users.  I am not sure there’s not much I see that I can do about that at this point.  I think the largest complaint I found was the lack of ALT tags on web content.  This would make navigating much easier for disabled users, but doesn’t seem to happen as much as it should.
            <h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
            JAWS screenreader is one device that is used for accessibility.  It allows users with sight or reading disabilities to surf the Internet and use programs.  Another device.  The other device that comes to mind is a TDD.  We had a TDD at one of my former workplaces for a coworker.  Essentially it transcribes a telephone conversation into a visible text conversation for those who are hearing-disabled.
            <h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
            VoiceOver is probably the most prominent iOS app I can think of off-hand.  MobileSpeak is another program that is popular in Europe.

            Although the data in some of the reference materials is over a year old now, the general consensus is still the same.  Mobile is here to stay, and poised to take over.  Due to costs, infrastructure and availability, more people will be using mobile devices to do tasks that were once reserved for computers than ever before.
            China recently passed 1 billion mobile subscribers and has now overtaken the US as the largest smartphone market.  Perhaps we should all be learning Mandarin Chinese programming?
            
            
            
            Anyhow, here are this weeks Q/A discussion questions:
            
            <h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h3>
            Currently in the United States the top app category is weather apps.  This stands to reason in that everyone, everywhere needs to plan for the weather.  Having the ability to check the weather while you are on the go is almost a necessity since the apps are available.  In second place (and not far behind) are social networking apps.  This again is no surprise with the current mentality of our society in that everyone thinks they need to know what everyone else is doing, where they are doing it at, and whom they are doing it with.  By the way, I am at home doing homework just in case you needed to know!  LOL!  Coming in third are map and navigational apps, and this makes total sense in that many people in our society are on the move, and when they are on the move they need to know where they are going.  What better way to do that then with a map-based mobile application.
            <h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h3>
            In Japan, with their society placing such a high emphasis on worker output, and pride in what you do. It comes as no surprise that Productivity apps top the charts.
            <h3>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h3>
            I am not sure how to interpret the data from England when it tells us that the top app category is entertainment.  Although from speaking with some friends that live in England, they do comment that ‘boring and dull’ are their two typical adjectives in describing most of their daily lives.  Perhaps the English are simply using their smartphones/tablets to get away from the doldrums?
            <h3>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h3>
            I think I already touched on each of these a bit within my answers without even realizing it, but I think that the ever-changing weather of the U.S. certainly concerns people here in their day-to-day planning of work and entertainment functions.  In Japan, obviously their societal values impel them to maximize their time and be as productive as possible.  And finally in England, the people seem to be looking for entertainment and excitement in what may otherwise be a very structured and dull environment.
            <h3>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S?</h3>
            In the article at http://www.technothon.com/android-os-versions-breakdown I found that ONLY 4.9% of Android users are currently using the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, while Gingerbread users account for 64.4% of users.
            <h3>How might these differences impact development?</h3>
            Well certainly developers should consider holding off for the time on implementing too many things that are Ice Cream Sandwich specific.  With that said though, most mobile users get new phones every 1-1/2 to 2 years.  So on a monthly basis, the number of Android users with access to Ice Cream Sandwich is going to climb.  At a certain point probably about 1-1/2 years from the release of ICS, the number of ICS users should exponentially increase as users of older phones upgrade to newer equipment and operating systems.  The key there will be to keep the Android users loyalty and prevent them from jumping ship to the rapidly growing and hotly debated iOS platform.
            <h3>What are the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets?</h3>
            Bandwidth costs are very different than I would have guessed.  In the article “How Much Are You Really Paying For Smartphone Data?”, http://www.validas.com/how-much-data-does-a-buck-buy-with-a-smartphone-how-much-are-you-actually-paying-per-megabyte/  the data reflects that United States customers pay $30-$60 for 2GB of data per month.  In the UK customers pay from $15-$50 per 2GB.  Japan is even less at $7-$20 per 2GB.  I suppose the wireless carriers in the UK and Japan can say that the cost is much less due to the much smaller infrastructure required.  They are, after all, on islands that in most cases are smaller than one State in the USA.
            <h3>How may this impact development?</h3>
            I am not sure this fact will impact development much.  I say this because although data is currently more expensive here in the United States, there is currently a huge push here for public WiFi and other alternatives to provide consumers with free or very low cost access with their mobile devices.
            <h3>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h3> 
            I certainly will push for app development in Western and European markets, as those are most familiar to me.  But after studying some of the data, it would seem foolish to completely ignore the possibility of writing apps for countries like China, Japan and India.  Just based on their raw population data, it seems like a target rich environment.
